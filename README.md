# Automated-Interpolation-Analysis
Uses a user-defined subsection of a DEM to determine the optimal interpolative range and the precision of subsampling at that range: 



* Requires a user-defined subset
* Automatically determines the optimal interpolation distance (Sill)
* Subsamples the defined area at this determined distance
* Interpolates for all possible subset-combinations at this distance
* Calculates the difference between estimations and measured heights at each point and graphs RMSE
