# Automated-Interpolation-Analysis
Uses a user-defined subsection of a DEM to determine the optimal interpolative range and the precision of subsampling at that range



Requires a user-defined subset

Automatically determines the optimal interpolation distance (Sill)
Subsamples the defined area at this determined distance
Interpolates for all possible subset-combinations at this distance
Calculates the difference between estimations and measured heights at each point and graphs them out
